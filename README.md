# 🧑‍💻 Portfolio V2
This is my second portfolio, on which I really put efforts. 
This is my second real project using React Js, and I'm proud of the result.

For the first time, I made a design before programming, 
and it really helped me find the design I wanted for the portfolio.

If you want to see the live version, here it is :
